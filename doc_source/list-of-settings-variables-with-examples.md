# List of settings variables with examples<a name="list-of-settings-variables-with-examples"></a>

The following table provides information about each of the format identifiers that you can use in your AWS Elemental MediaConvert job\. For information about format identifiers that function differently in streaming outputs, see [Using settings variables with streaming outputs](using-settings-variables-with-streaming-outputs.md)\.


| Format identifier | Value to put in the job setting | Compatible job settings | Description and example | 
| --- |--- |--- |--- |
| Date and time |  `$dt$`  |  Destination Name modifier Segment modifier  |  UTC date and time of the start time of the job\. Format: YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS Example: For a job that starts at 3:05:28 PM on June 4, 2020, **$dt$** resolves to `20200604T150528`\.   | 
| Date |  `$d$`  |  Destination Name modifier Segment modifier  |  UTC date of the start time of the job\.  Format: YYYYMMDD Example: For a job that starts on June 4, 2020, **$d$** resolves to `20200604`\.   | 
| Time |  `$t$`  |  Destination Name modifier Segment modifier  |  UTC start time of the job\.  Format: HHMMSS Example: For a job that starts at 3:05:28 PM, **$t$** resolves to `150528`\.   | 
| Video bitrate |  `$rv$`  |  Name modifier Segment modifier  |  The video bitrate of the output, in kilobits\. For QVBR outputs, the service uses video max bitrate, in kilobits\. Example: If you set **Encoding settings**, **Video**, **Bitrate \(bits/s\)** to **50000000**, **$rv$** resolves to `50000`\.  | 
| Audio bitrate |  `$ra$`  |  Name modifier Segment modifier  |  Total of all the audio bitrates in the output, in kilobits\. Example: If you have an output with a single audio tab and you set **Encoding settings**, **Audio 1**, **Bitrate \(kbit/s\)** to **256000**, **$ra$** resolves to `256000`\.  | 
| Container bitrate |  `$rc$`  |  Name modifier Segment modifier  |  Combined audio and video bitrate for the output, in kilobits\. Example: You have an output with a **Video** settings tab and **Audio 1** settings tab\. If you set **Encoding settings**, **Video**, **Bitrate \(bits/s\)** to **5000000** and you set **Encoding settings**, **Audio**, **Bitrate \(bits/s\)** to **96000** \(96 kilobits\), **$rc$** resolves to `5096`\.  | 
| Video frame width |  `$w$`  |  Name modifier Segment modifier  |  The frame width, or horizontal resolution, in pixels\. Example: If you set **Encoding settings**, **Video**, **Resolution \(w x h\)** to **1280** x **720** , **$w$** resolves to `1280`\.  | 
| Video frame height |  `$h$`  |  Name modifier Segment modifier  |  The frame height, or vertical resolution, in pixels\. Example: If you set **Encoding settings**, **Video**, **Resolution \(w x h\)** to **1280** x **720** , **$h$** resolves to `720`\.  | 
| Framerate |  `$f$`  |  Name modifier Segment modifier  |  Framerate, in frames per second, truncated to the nearest whole number\.  Example: If your framerate is **59\.940**, **$f$** resolves to `59`\.   | 
| Input file name |  `$fn$`  |  Destination Name modifier Segment modifier  |  Name of the input file, without the file extension\. For jobs that have multiple inputs, this is the first file specified in the job\. Example: If **Input 1** for your job is **s3://mediaconvert\-input/my\-video\.mov**, **$fn$** resolves to `my-video`\.  | 
| Output container file extension |  `$ex$`  |  Name modifier Segment modifier  |  Varies depending on the output group\. For **File group** outputs, this is the extension of the output container file\. For other output groups, this is the extension of the manifest\. Example for file group: If you choose **MPEG2\-TS** for **Output settings**, **Container**, **$ex$** resolves to `m2ts`\. Example for HLS group: If your output group is HLS, **$ex$** resolves to `m3u8`\.  | 
| $ |  `$$`  |  Name modifier Segment modifier  |  Escaped `$`\. Example:  Suppose that you provide the following values:    Input file name: **file1\.mp4**   Destination: **s3://mediaconvert\-input/**   Name modifier: **my\-video$$hi\-res\-**   Your output file name and path resolves to `s3://mediaconvert-input/my-video$hi-res-file1.mp4`\.  |
