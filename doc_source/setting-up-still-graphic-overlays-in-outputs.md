# Setting up still graphic overlays in outputs<a name="setting-up-still-graphic-overlays-in-outputs"></a>

Because you're setting up an output overlay, set up image insertion in each output where you want the service to overlay graphics on your video\. For information about setting up an overlay that appears on all outputs, or on portions that correspond to only one input, see [Choosing between input overlay and output overlay](choosing-between-input-overlay-and-output-overlay.md)\.

If you don't specify overlay start time and duration, the service puts the overlay on the entire output\.

**To set up a still graphic overlay in an output**

1. Open the AWS Elemental MediaConvert console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/mediaconvert](https://console.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert)\.

1. Set up your output groups and outputs for video and audio, as described in [Setting up a job in AWS Elemental MediaConvert](setting-up-a-job.md) and [Creating outputs with AWS Elemental MediaConvert](creating-streaming-and-file-outputs.md)\.

1. For each output that you want to have a graphic overlay, do the following:

   1. On the **Create job** page, in the **Job** pane on the left, under **Output groups**, choose the appropriate output\.

   1. Under **Encoding** settings, under the **Video** tab, find the **Preprocessors** section\.

   1. Choose **Image inserter**\. This displays an **Add image** button\.

   1. For each graphic overlay that you want to include in the output, choose **Add image**, and then specify the overlay settings\.

      For **Image location**, specify an input file that is stored in Amazon S3 or on an HTTP\(S\) server\. For Amazon S3 inputs, you can specify the URI directly or choose **Browse** to select from your Amazon S3 buckets\. For HTTP\(S\) inputs, provide the URL to your input file\. For more information, see [HTTP input requirements](upload-input-files.md#http-input-requirements)\.
