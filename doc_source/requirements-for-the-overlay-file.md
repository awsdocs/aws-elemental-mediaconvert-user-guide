# Requirements for the overlay file<a name="requirements-for-the-overlay-file"></a>

Set up the image files that you want to insert over your video as follows:
+ **File type**: Use \.png or \.tga\.
+ **Aspect ratio**: Use any aspect ratio; it doesn't need to match the aspect ratio of the underlying video\.
+ **Size in pixels**: Use any size\. If the overlaid graphic is larger than the output video frame, the service crops the graphic at the edge of the frame\.
**Note**  
In jobs that scale the video resolution, whether your overlay scales with your video depends on where you specify the graphic overlay\. For more information, see [About sizing your overlay to account for scaling](about-overlay-scaling.md)\.
