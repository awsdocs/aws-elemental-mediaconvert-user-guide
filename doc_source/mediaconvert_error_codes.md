# Error codes<a name="mediaconvert_error_codes"></a>

MediaConvert returns error codes when transcoding jobs run into problems\. You can use Amazon EventBridge to track the error codes that the service returns\.

This table provides detailed information about error codes and messages that MediaConvert returns, their possible causes, and solutions\.

**Note**  
MediaConvert charges your account only when a job reaches the `COMPLETED` status\. You don't pay for jobs that end in an `ERROR` status\.


| Error code | Message | Details | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  1010  |  Input Error  |  The service can't open one or more of your input files\. Possible causes are as follows: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/mediaconvert_error_codes.html)  | 
|  1020  |  Video Error  |  The service can't find any video in your input stream\. The service was able to open and read your input file, but couldn't find a video elementary stream\. Possible causes are as follows: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/mediaconvert_error_codes.html)  | 
|  1021  |  Audio Error  |  The service can't find any audio in your input stream\. The service was able to open and read your input file, but couldn't find an audio elementary stream\. Possible causes are as follows: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/mediaconvert_error_codes.html)  | 
|  1030  |  Unsupported Codec  |  The service doesn't support the codec or container of the input file\. See [Supported input codecs and containers](reference-codecs-containers-input.md)\.  | 
|  1040  |  Settings Error  |  One or more of the job's encoding settings aren't supported in the combination specified\. Or, the encoding settings aren't compatible with the input\.   | 
| 1041 | Acceleration Settings Error | Your job settings aren't compatible with accelerated transcoding\. See [Job limitations for accelerated transcoding in AWS Elemental MediaConvert](job-requirements.md)\. | 
| 1042 | Job Doesn't Require Enough Processing Power for Accelerated Transcoding | This job doesn't require enough processing power to benefit from accelerated transcoding\. Consider using accelerated transcoding for jobs that would otherwise take 10 minutes or longer to run\. | 
|  1050  |  Disk Full  |  Write error, disk full\. Try reducing the number of outputs in the job, or reducing the length of the output\.  | 
|  1056  |  File Open Error  |  The service can't open an input or output file\. Possible causes are as follows: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/mediaconvert_error_codes.html)  | 
|  1060  |  Clipping Error  |  The start and end timecodes specified for an input clip don't exist in the associated input stream\.  A possible cause is that the input clipping timecodes are specified starting from zero, but the embedded timecodes start at a time other than `00:00:00:00`\. To solve this, set both the input **Timecode source** and the **Timecode configuration** **Source** under **Job settings** to **Start at 0**\.  | 
|  1075  |  Demuxer Parse Error  |  MediaConvert couldn't recover from a problematic file when demuxing\. [Verify that you have provided a supported input](reference-codecs-containers-input.md)\. If MediaConvert supports your input, open a case with AWS Support\.  | 
|  1076  |  Source Read Error  |  The transcoder couldn't read from one of the input files\. The file might have an unexpected end of file\. Verify that your input file is valid and that it's truncated properly\.  | 
|  1080  |  MXF Output Error  |  There is a problem in the way that the MXF output settings are configured in your job\. Check that these settings are correct and valid per specification\.  | 
|  1091  |  Encryption Error  |  There was an error encrypting one or more of the job outputs\. Verify that the IAM role that you chose in your MediaConvert job settings provides access to invoke Amazon API Gateway\.  For more information about setting up this IAM role, see [Set Up IAM Permissions](iam-role.md) in this guide\.  | 
|  1092  |  Decode Audio Initialization Error  |  MediaConvert can't decode one or more of your input audio streams\. MediaConvert supports the codec and container, but there is a problem with the audio source that prevents the transcoder from reading it\.  | 
|  1401  |  Permissions Issue  |  Amazon S3 denied access to a file or bucket\. Check the bucket policies on your input and output locations\. Also check that the job has the right IAM role specified and that the role has the necessary permissions\.

|  1507  |  Disk Full  |  Write error, disk full\. Try reducing the number of outputs in the job, or reducing the length of the output\.  | 
|  1515  |  IAM Role Error  |  The role specified in your MediaConvert job settings doesn't have the necessary permissions or is malformed\. Check that the job has the right IAM role specified and that the role has the correct permissions\.

For more information, see [HTTP input requirements](upload-input-files.md#http-input-requirements)\.   | 
| 3403 | HTTP Access Forbidden |  You specified an HTTP URL for an input file, but the HTTP server refuses the request\. Check that you have specified the correct URL\. If you have, contact the team that is responsible for maintaining the HTTP server that hosts your file\.  |
