# Using Dolby Atmos passthrough with AWS Elemental MediaConvert<a name="using-dolby-atmos-passthrough"></a>

AWS Elemental MediaConvert can create Dolby Digital Plus with Atmos outputs by either encoding audio in 9\.1\.6, 7\.1\.4, or 5\.1\.4 PCM mono channels, or by passing through already encoded Dolby Digital Plus with Atmos content\.

You set up your job to pass through Dolby Digital Plus with Atmos content in the same way that you pass through Dolby Digital and Dolby Digital Plus content\.

**To set up a Dolby Atmos job, passing through finished audio content**

1. Open the MediaConvert console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/mediaconvert](https://console.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert)\.

1. Choose **Create job**\.

1. Set up your input audio and video as described in [Setting up a job in AWS Elemental MediaConvert](setting-up-a-job.md)\.

1. Set up your output groups, outputs, and video output selectors as described in [Setting up a job in AWS Elemental MediaConvert](setting-up-a-job.md) and [Creating outputs with AWS Elemental MediaConvert](creating-streaming-and-file-outputs.md)\. Choose supported containers as listed in [Supported output codecs and containers](reference-codecs-containers.md)\.

1. Create audio output selectors as described in [Setting up a job in AWS Elemental MediaConvert](setting-up-a-job.md) and [Creating outputs with AWS Elemental MediaConvert](creating-streaming-and-file-outputs.md)\.

   Set them up as follows:

   1. In the **Job** pane on the left, choose an output that includes audio\.

   1. In the **Encoding settings** section, choose **Audio 1**\.

   1. For **Audio codec**, choose **Passthrough**\.
