**To set up a Dolby Atmos job, with audio inputs as 16 individual \.wav files**<a name="proc-atmos-separate-input-files"></a>

1. Open the MediaConvert console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/mediaconvert](https://console.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert)\.

1. Choose **Create job**\.

1. Set up your input video as described in [Setting up a job in AWS Elemental MediaConvert](setting-up-a-job.md)\.

1. Set up your input audio selectors as follows:

   1. On the **Create job** page, in the **Job** pane on the left, choose **Input**\.

   1. On the right, in the **Audio selectors** section, under **Audio selector 1**, choose **External file**\.

   1. For **External file**, provide the path and file name to the \.wav file for your first channel\. For **Audio selector 1**, this channel must be L\. 
**Important**  
You must set up the channels in the following order: L, R, C, LFE, Ls, Rs, Lrs, Rrs, Lw, Rw, Ltf, Rtf, Ltm, Rtm, Ltr, Rtr\.   
That is, if your input audio is in separate \.wav files, **Audio selector 1** must point to the L channel, **Audio selector 2** must point to the R channel, and so on\.

   1. At the top of the **Audio selectors** section, choose **Add audio selector** to create **Audio selector 2**\.

   1. Under **Audio selector 2**, choose **External file**\.

   1. Specify the path and file name to the \.wav file for your second channel\. For **Audio selector 2**, this channel must be R\.

   1. Repeat the steps to create an audio selector for the rest of your 16 channels\. Choose the following channels for each selector:
      + **Audio selector 3**: C
      + **Audio selector 4**: LFE
      + **Audio selector 5**: Ls
      + **Audio selector 6**: Rs
      + **Audio selector 7**: Lrs
      + **Audio selector 8**: Rrs
      + **Audio selector 9**: Lw
      + **Audio selector 10**: Rw
      + **Audio selector 11**: Ltf
      + **Audio selector 12**: Rtf
      + **Audio selector 13**: Ltm
      + **Audio selector 14**: Rtm
      + **Audio selector 15**: Ltr
      + **Audio selector 16**: Rtr

1. Create an input **Audio selector group** as follows:

   1. In the **Audio selector groups** section, choose **Add audio selector group**\.

   1. For **Group name**, enter a descriptive name, such as **Dolby Atmos Audio Group**\.

   1. For **Select audio selectors**, choose each audio selector that you created earlier in this procedure\. Choose them in order, starting with **Audio selector 1**\.

1. Set up your output groups, outputs, and video output selectors as described in [Setting up a job in AWS Elemental MediaConvert](setting-up-a-job.md) and [Creating outputs with AWS Elemental MediaConvert](creating-streaming-and-file-outputs.md)\. Choose supported containers as listed in [Feature Restrictions for Dolby Atmos Encoding](#feature-restrictions-for-dolby-atmos-encoding)\.
