# Getting started with AWS Elemental MediaConvert<a name="getting-started"></a>

This Getting Started tutorial shows you how to use the AWS Elemental MediaConvert console to transcode media files in a few basic steps\. To get started accessing MediaConvert programmatically, see the following topics in the API reference:
+ If you are using one of the AWS SDKs, see [Getting started with the SDKs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/apireference/custom-endpoints.html)\.
+ If you are using the MediaConvert API directly, see [Getting started with the API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/apireference/getting-started.html)\.

MediaConvert takes in an input file and the information that you provide about that file and turns it into one or more output files, based on the instructions and transcoding settings that you provide\. 

**Note**  
If you aren't familiar with jobs, queues, presets, and job templates—the basic concepts behind MediaConvert—we recommend that you take a quick look at [What is AWS Elemental MediaConvert?](what-is.md) before you begin the tutorial\.
