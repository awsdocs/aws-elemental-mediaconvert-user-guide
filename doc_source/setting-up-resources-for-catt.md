# Setting up AWS Elemental MediaConvert resources for cost allocation through tagging<a name="setting-up-resources-for-catt"></a>

For all outputs that you produce using an on\-demand queue, you can use the AWS Billing and Cost Management dashboard to set up a monthly cost allocation report\. This report shows what AWS charges you for transcoding, sorted by resource\. You can set up your jobs so that your job outputs are sorted by tags on the job or on a resource that you use to create the job\. That is, you can sort your bill by the tags that you put on the job, on the queue that you submit the job to, on the job template that you create the job from, or on the output presets that you use to set up the individual outputs of the job\.

**To set up cost allocation through tagging for your AWS Elemental MediaConvert charges**

1. Tag the resources that you intend to sort your bill by\. For instructions, see the other topics in this chapter\.

1. Create your transcoding jobs, specifying how you want your costs allocated as follows:

   1. On the **Create job** page, in the **Job** pane on the left, under **Job settings**, choose **AWS integration**\.

   1. In the **Job settings** section on the right, under **AWS integration**, for **Billing tag source**, choose which tags you want to use to sort the job's outputs\. You can choose to sort by tags on a resource that you use to create the jobâ€”job template, output preset, or queue\. Or you can choose **Job** to sort by the tags on the job itself\.
**Note**  
Jobs, and the tags on them, persist for only 90 days\. If your workflow references tags over longer periods of time, use tags on the queue, job template, or output preset rather than tags on the job\.

1. Activate these tags on the AWS Billing and Cost Management dashboard\. For more information, see [Activating user\-defined cost allocation tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/activating-tags.html) in the *Billing and Cost Management User Guide*\.
