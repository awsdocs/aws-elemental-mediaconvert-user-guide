# Foundational video concepts and related AWS Elemental MediaConvert settings<a name="video-settings"></a>

If you are doing simple transcodes—to change which devices can play your video asset, to reduce the file size, or to change the resolution—you can often rely on [job templates](working-with-job-templates.md) or [output presets](working-with-presets.md) to choose your video settings for you\. But, if you want to make specific adjustments to how your video is encoded, you need to adjust your video settings individually\. 

For information about each setting, view the setting description\. You can find the description by clicking the **Info** link next to the setting on the MediaConvert console\. Or, you can find the description in the [Jobs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/apireference/jobs.html) topic of the *AWS Elemental MediaConvert API Reference*\. To find a specific setting, you might use your browser's search function or follow a link to the setting from the schemas, which show the settings in a structured manner\.

For some of the MediaConvert transcoding settings, the following topics provide additional details, conceptual explanations, and information about values to provide that are suitable for your use case\.
