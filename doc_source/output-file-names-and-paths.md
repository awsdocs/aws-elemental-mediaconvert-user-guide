# Output file names and paths<a name="output-file-names-and-paths"></a>

The EventBridge job `COMPLETE` notification includes details about your output in JSON\. This information includes the file names and paths for the outputs of the jobâ€”including manifests as well as the media assets\.

The files that AWS Elemental MediaConvert creates depends on the output groups that you set up in the job\. For example, DASH ISO packages contain an \.mpd manifest and \.mp4 media fragment files\.

You can find output file name and path information in the following properties:

`playlistFilePaths`  
A list of the Amazon S3 file paths to the top\-level manifests\.

`outputFilePaths`  
The file path to either the media or the manifest, depending on the output group type\.

`type`  
The type of output group, which determines what files are listed in the `playlistFilePaths` and `outputFilePaths`\.

The following table summarizes the values for these properties, depending on the output group type\.
