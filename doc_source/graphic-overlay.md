# Using image inserter \(graphic overlay\) in AWS Elemental MediaConvert<a name="graphic-overlay"></a>

With the image inserter \(graphic overlay\) feature, you can insert a still image or motion graphic at a specified time\. You can also display it as an overlay on the underlying video for a specified duration\. This feature includes fade\-in and fade\-out capability and adjustable opacity\.

You can set up an output with multiple overlays\. Each overlay is independent of the others\. For example, you can place a motion graphic logo in the video frame for the duration of the video, and include a still image HDR indicator only for portions of the file that are HDR\. Each overlay has its own settings for opacity, fade\-in and fade\-out times, position on the frame, and length of time on the video\. You can set up overlays to appear on the underlying video at the same time, or to overlap each other\.
